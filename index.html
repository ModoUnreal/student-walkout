        <h2>Student Walkout Against Gun Violence</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>American students live in the only developed country where mass shootings happen regularly. Demand that your state and federal lawmakers adopt deeper background checks, stricter licensing requirements, and limited access to semiautomatic firearms. Only then will students finally be safe to learn.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-title">
        <h4>What This Is</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
        <p>This is a protest against gun violence and against Congress' unwillingness to uphold stronger gun laws.</p>
        <p>This is a plea for help from students who have known school shootings all their life and demand change.</p>
        <p>And lastly this is a message to say that we don't want any more empty words and passivity towards mass murder. We deserve a safer environment for us to learn in.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-title">
        <h4>How will we send this message?</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
        <p>We will have multiple student walkouts in the next couple of months.</p>
        <p>What we want is for students to attend school and promptly walk out of school at the designated time, issued below, and <strong>peacefully</strong> protest outside of your schools.</p>
        <p>Through this our message will be effectively given, and that's exactly what is needed right now.</p>

    </div>
<!--
    <div class="unit">
        <p>So far this year there has been eight school shootings that have resulted in the injury or death of innocent civilians in schools. This is unacceptable and should be stopped no matter what.</p> 
    </div>

    <div class="unit>">
        <p>So how do we stop this? Simple. We protest peacefully and walk out of class on the designated dates. This isn't just students trying to bunk off of schools, this is us trying to make our voices be heard.</p>
    </div>
